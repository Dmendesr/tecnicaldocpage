            Complete beginner
            If you are a complete beginner to web development, we'd recommend that you start by working through our Getting started with the web module, which provides a practical introduction to web development.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Getting started with the web is a concise series introducing you to the practicalities of web development. You'll set up the tools you need to construct a simple webpage and publish your own simple code.</li></ul>
            <p>Beyond the basics
            If you have a bit of knowledge already, the next step is to learn HTML and CSS in detail: start with our Introduction to HTML module and move on to our CSS first steps module.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.</li>
            <pre>
            <code> /*Anatomy of an HTML element */
              class="An atribute and its value" Enclosed text content</code></pre>
            <li>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser.
            The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.
            <pre>
            <code>/* The selector "p" indicates that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */
            p {
            /* The "color" property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */
            color: yellow;   
            /* The "background-color" property defines the background color, in this case black.*/
            background-color: black;
            }
            </code>
            </pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Moving onto scripting</p>
          <ul><li>If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move on to JavaScript or server-side development. Begin with our JavaScript first steps and Server-side first steps modules.</li></ul>
          <p>Frameworks and tooling</p>
          <ul><li>After mastering the essentials of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you should learn about client-side web development tools, and then consider digging into client-side JavaScript frameworks, and server-side website programming.</li></ul>

          Getting started with the web</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            Getting started with the web is a concise series introducing you to the practicalities of web development. You'll set up the tools you need to construct a simple webpage and publish your own simple code.<br>
            <pre>
            <code>/*If we wanted the text to stand by itself,we could specify that it is a paragraph by
            enclosing it in a paragragraph &lt;p&gt; element:*/<br> 
            &lt;p&gt; My dog is an old gentleman &lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            </pre>
            </li></ul>
            <p>Structuring the web with HTML</p>
            <ul>
            <li>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.</li></ul>
            <p>Learn to style HTML using CSS</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.<br>
            Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it. Again, the HTML is as follows:<br>
            <p>    
            <pre>
            <code>
            Let's use:
            &lt;span&gt;Cascading&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Style&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;Sheets&lt;/span&gt;
            </code>    
            </pre>
            Let's suppose we apply the following CSS to it:
            <pre>
            <code>
              span {
                border: 1px solid black;
                background-color: lime;
              }
            </code>
            </pre>
            The updated output is as follows:<br>
            Lets use:
            <span>Cascading</span>
            <span>Style</span>
            <span>Sheets</span>              

        </p>
            </li></ul>
            <p>JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting</p>
            <ul><li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</li></ul>

            To access a flexible way that allows for automatic updates, you can follow the folowing instructions:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Install Git on your machine. This is the underlying version control system software that GitHub works on top of.</li>
              <li>Open your computer's command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux, macOS).</li>
              <li>You can now enter the directory and find the files you are after (either using your Finder/File Explorer or the cd command).</li>

        <ul><li>In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

            First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.
            
            Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.</li></ul>

        </p>
        <ul><li>While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

            Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.
            
            Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).</li></ul>
